Thank you for purchasing Word Guess!

Word Guess is an asset to get you going asap with your Wordle like game.
It's very easy to get going with only two steps but it's highly customizeable.

Quick start guide on how to use the Word Guess asset:
1. In your toolbar go to "Tools/WordGuessSetup" to open the setup window.
2. In the window press "Generate".

That's pretty much it.
If you wan't to change the settings you can select the "WordGuessManager" GameObject in the Hierarchy
or generate a new one using the "Word Guess Setup".

Good Luck!
